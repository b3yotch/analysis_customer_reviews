# LLM Analysis

## 1. Product Categories with Most 1-Star Reviews in Canada
The only product category with multiple 1-star reviews in Canada is:

Prom Dresses: 2 reviews

Other categories may exist with 1-star reviews, but only this one appears more than once in the dataset.

## 2. Correlation Between Order Value and Rating
Correlation coefficient (r): -0.028

P-value: 0.789

ðŸ”Ž Interpretation:
There is no meaningful correlation between higher order values and lower ratings.

The correlation is very close to zero and not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

This means order value doesn't impact how customers rate the product in this dataset.

## 3.summarize the top 5 complaints and top 5 compliments across all reviews

  The rating distribution is as follows:
| Rating   | Count |
| :------- | :---- |
| **1.0**  | 19    |
| **2.0**  | 15    |
| **2.78** | 19    |
| **3.0**  | 16    |
| **4.0**  | 9     |
| **5.0**  | 14    |

For our analysis:

Negative feedback = Ratings 1.0 and 2.0

Note: Thereâ€™s a recurring value 2.78, likely indicating missing or placeholder values. Iâ€™ll exclude this value from both complaints and compliments analysis as it's neither low nor high feedback.

Proceeding to extract:

Top 5 complaints from reviews with Ratings 1.0 or 2.0

Top 5 compliments from reviews with Ratings 5.0

Iâ€™ll perform basic keyword frequency analysis for both.
