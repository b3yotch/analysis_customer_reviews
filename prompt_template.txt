You are a data analyst. I will provide you with a CSV file containing e-commerce order and review data. Your task is to analyze the data and answer the following stakeholder questions:

Which product categories have the most 1-star reviews in Canada?

Do higher order values correlate with lower ratings? Please explain with correlation analysis.

Can you summarize the top 5 complaints and top 5 compliments across all review texts?

Which fulfillment statuses are most associated with negative feedback (ratings 1 or 2)?

Assume the file contains at least the following columns (if present):

Product Name, Product Category, rating, Review Content, Order Value, Fulfillment Status

Return your response as a combination of insights, summary tables, and visualizations if needed. Let me know if columns are missing or if any data cleaning is required.
